## Never Could Have Been Worse
Shortly prior to your arrival, a Vast (the coloquial term for Sparr's native and (mostly) subterranean megafauna) hunting party twelve-strong departed Northeast-bound from the Yuga Pocket with the intent of reaching a less-travelled entrance.

Six hours into the eight-hour journey, the group went completely radio and GPS silent. 

Due to the nature of Vast hunting and the congregate survival and combat experience of the hunting party, it is unlikely they were ill prepared for any hostile encounter. Regardless, a first-respondent team was of six was dispatched to their last known position to inquire about their status.

As of 04:00 hours today, they have also went completely silent; at the same location, nonetheless.
